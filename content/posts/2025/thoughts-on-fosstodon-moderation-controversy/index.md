In recent days, Fosstodon (a Mastodon instance) has become an example of how even well-intentioned communities can go sideways when communication breaks down and everyone starts shouting past each other.  I’ve been following the drama with a mix of frustration and disappointment.

At the center of the discussion was a moderator known as *carrotcypher*, whose conduct sparked concern among users for reportedly demonstrating what was described as hostility toward supposedly marginalized people in other public spaces. Instead of addressing these concerns transparently and with care, much of the Fosstodon community reaction turned toward extremism, labeling the entire moderation team, including co-founders Mike Stone and Kev Quirk, as "fascists".

This is not only inaccurate; it’s counterproductive. Let's be honest, that word has meaning. It is not just a catch-all for "people you disagree with." Throwing it around so carelessly cheapens real critiques, poisons the atmosphere for everyone involved and makes it nearly impossible to have good-faith dialogues.

Were moderation missteps made on Fosstodon? Apparently not. Is the moderator perceived to act in ways that contradict the community’s stated values? Maybe... But it’s vital for the community to remain grounded. Turning complex, human situations into black-and-white narratives of tyranny vs. justice does little to help resolve real issues. Instead, it fans flames of paranoia and drives away the people trying to keep the platform functioning.

{{< url "Kev Quirk wrote that he is stepping down" "https://kevquirk.com/blog/my-thoughts-on-the-fosstodon-drama">}}, citing burnout and an exhaustion with the constant stream of drama. In his blog post, he expressed a genuine desire to "step away from the entire Fedi, or just move to another instance". Meanwhile, Mike Stone has tried to emphasize that {{< url "moderation actions are discussed as a team and not dictated by any single individual" "https://mikestone.me/2025-04-28-do-what-you-love" >}}.

But despite these clarifications, the discourse on Fosstodon has become increasingly hostile. The energy that once went into sharing projects, helping newcomers, and supporting free software is now diverted into moderation arguments and ideological policing.

It’s entirely valid to demand accountability from admins and moderators. It’s also good to point out failures in leadership. But equating an alleged mismanagement or not-as-desired moderation decisions with fascism is inaccurate and corrosive. It shuts down dialogue, simplifies complex issues, and ultimately poisons the well for everyone who still wants the community to survive.

If this instance wants to be more than just another broken node in the Fediverse, it’s time for real reflection on all sides. A community can’t function without mutual respect, even when people disagree.

Fosstodon isn’t being crushed by fascists. It’s not being saved by revolutionaries either. It’s just burning out. And it didn’t have to end up this way. Whether you stay on it or not, maybe ask yourself what kind of community you're helping to build.

This is a quick update on Sveltia CMS.

I recently shared my [thoughts on it]({{< relref "/posts/2025/thoughts-on-sveltiacms/index.md" >}}), and a few days later, the dev team released {{< url "version 0.70.0" "https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/releases/tag/v0.70.0">}}, which now officially supports mobile devices! ðŸ“±

This update has made my life easier. I can review and update content right from my phone, whether Iâ€™m commuting, traveling, or just away from my desk. Super convenient and a big win for flexibility.
